# c-can

A controller area network (CAN) library written in C.

## Background

Remote CAN data logging with an armv7l processor resulted in dropped CAN frames while using the 
`python-can` package. When supplied 500 messages per second with a bitrate of 250 kb/s (about a 
57% bus load), the `python-can` package missed more than 13% of messages. This library, 
`c-can`, captures all messages sent on the CAN bus when running on an armv7l processor.
